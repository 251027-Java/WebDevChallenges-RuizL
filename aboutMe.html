            My name is Liam Ruiz-Steblein. I recently graduated from Rice University
            with a degree in Computer Science. I try to maintain good relationships 
            with my friends by consistently calling to catch up and stay involved 
            in their lives. I'm always down for adventures, whether that be a thrift 
            store trip or a nice hike. I enjoy listening to music ranging from jazz 
            to indie pop. A couple of my favorite artists are: Malcolm Todd, Hozier, 
            and The Neighbourhood.
